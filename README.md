# LUIT June 2025 - Blue Cohort: Python Fundamentals

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Level Up In Tech (LUIT) June 2025 Blue Cohort â€“ Python Track**!  
This repo is dedicated to learning Python, sharing best practices, and building a strong foundation in software development and DevOps with Python.

## ðŸ“˜ What Youâ€™ll Learn

- Python basics (syntax, variables, data types)
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and modules
- File handling
- Error handling
- Working with APIs and external libraries
- Intro to testing and automation
- Python for DevOps (scripting, tools, and automation)

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/luit-june-2025-blue-python.git
   cd luit-june-2025-blue-python
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

   Optionally, create a virtual environment:

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   If a `requirements.txt` file exists:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
